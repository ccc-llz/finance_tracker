### Project Overview: Personal Finance & Budget Tracker

#### The Problem the Project Addresses
With the ever-rising cost of living and the abundance of financial products in today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with managing their finances effectively. 

Common challenges include tracking daily expenses across multiple sources (e.g., bank accounts, credit cards, and cash), understanding spending patterns without clear visualisation, and maintaining motivation to achieve savings goals. As a result, people often face overspending, accumulation of debt, and are left with little room for emergencies or long-term objectives like retirement. This project addresses these issues by providing an intuitive, all-in-one tool that simplifies expense aggregation. The tool offers insightful data visualisation and aims to help users set and track realistic savings goals, ultimately promoting financial literacy and stability.

**2. Spending Visualization & Habit Analysis**

- Interactive charts, graphs, and reports (e.g., pie charts for category breakdowns, line graphs for monthly trends)
- Visualise spending habits and patterns
- Spending heatmap (GitHub-style activity view)
- Categorise expenses with tags
- Add images and notes to expenses

**3. Savings Goal Setting & Tracking**

- Secure data encryption and multi-device synchronisation

**7. Email Features & Knowledge Sharing**

#### The High-Level Goals
- Encourage users to gain control over their finances by reducing manual tracking efforts and providing actionable insights. 
- Foster better financial habits through data-driven visualisations and goal-oriented features, aiming to help users reach their savings goals.
